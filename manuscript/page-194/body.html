Big tears coursed down the boy's cheeks, till at last he   hid his face in his hands, and wept bitterly. Kiran came back from the room and said: "I am sure Nilkanta has not taken the inkstand." Sharat and Satish were equally positive that no other than Nilkanta could have done it.</p><p>But Kiran said determinedly: "Never."</p><p>Sharat wanted to cross-examine the boy, but his wife refused to allow it.</p><p>Then Satish suggested that his room and box should be searched. And Kiran said: "If you dare do such a thing I will never forgive you. You shall not spy on the poor innocent boy." And as she spoke, her wonderful eyes filled with tears. That settled the matter and effectually prevented any further molestation of Nilkanta.</p></div> </div>
