An earthen lamp burned beside them.</p><p>The husband, Sharat, was saying: "I wish you would stay on a few days more; you would then be able to return home quite strong again."</p><p>The wife, Kiran, was saying: "I have quite recovered already. It will not, cannot possibly, do me any harm to go home now."</p><p>Every married person will at once understand that the conversation was not quite so brief as I have   reported it. The matter was not difficult, but the arguments for and against did not advance it towards a solution. Like a rudderless boat, the discussion kept turning round and round the same point; and at last threatened to be overwhelmed in a flood of tears.</p><p>Sharat said: "The doctor thinks you should stop here a few days longer."</p></div> </div>
