The English verbs such as "receive," "conceive," "perceive" have come into English from the French. The Latin root is more clearly seen in the nouns such as "deception," "reception," "perception," etc. It should be carefully noticed that these "French" forms   are spelt eive instead of ieve. A simple rule is this, that after c write ei not ie, but after other consonants write ie. Compare the spelling of believe, grieve, relieve with that of receive, deceive.</li></ul><hr class="section"></div> </div>
